# Basics of C++  
## Commenting:  
Comments are lines in code that act as notes or headers, where they have no effect on the code.  
1. To make a single line comment type **//** followed by text. 
2. To make a multiple line comment type **/*** and to complete the comment type ***/**.

## Includes:
Includes are header files that are stated at the beginning of the code.
1. For example, #include <iostream>, instructs the preprocessor to include a section of standard C++ code, called header iostream, that allows it to perform input and output operations.
### Include Statement Examples:
- #include <string>
- #include <sstream>
- #include <Robot.h>
- #include <iostream>

- #include <stdlib.h>
- #include <frc/Timer.h>
